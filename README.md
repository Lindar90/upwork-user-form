# Upwork FE assignment

Hello dear Upwork team,

For your convenience, I deployed the working application to Netlify. You could find it here: https://62570caa3f0cbd11531d5555--chic-kashata-49d2bb.netlify.app/

Current version of the app has been using the following stack:
```
- Vue 3 + Vue CLI + composition API
- Typescript
- Tailwind CSS
- Jest
- and Cypress for E2E tests
```

For the server side fake API service has been used: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
